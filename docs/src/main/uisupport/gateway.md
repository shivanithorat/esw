# User Interface Gateway

This is provided to give access to all CSW and ESW services and components from browser-based user interfaces.

## ESW Gateway with Authentication and Authorization

All TMT users use browser-based user interfaces to interact with the control system, and all TMT users must be
authenticated. Once authenticated, they are authorized to use certain commands based on their roles. 
All UI programs must use the UI Gateway to reach the control system. The UI Gateway provides authorization and authentication 
in the ESW/CSW system. 

ESW UI Gateway is accessible to the outside network and exposes API endpoints through an HTTP interface, hence we need to
protect its endpoints from unauthorized access. To better understand the inside and outside network terminology, refer @link:[network-topology](https://tmtsoftware.github.io/csw/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/deployment/network-topology.html) { open=new }.
  
### Protection on Command Service Endpoints on Gateway

Each subsystem can control command access using three roles: **user**, **eng**, and **admin**. 
For example: APS-user, APS-eng, and APS-admin.
The user role is the least restrictive, eng role more restrictive, and admin the most restrictive. The eng role is
meant for commands that should only be executed by qualified subsystem engineers. The admin command role should be reserved
for commands that may damage or otherwise risk equipment. A subsystem is not required to have eng or admin role commands.
It's okay to have only commands that are accessible to all subsystem users.  

A TMT user must at least have a subsystem's user role to be allowed to access commands in a subsystem.
By default, all commands are available to a user with the user role unless they are listed in the command map 
as requiring a more restrictive role. The hierarchy of roles is shown in the following figure:

![Role Hierarchy](../images/gateway/role-hierarchy.png)
 
There are often commands which are more restrictive and should not be accessible to every user. These commands 
need eng or admin role for the most restricted or dangerous commands. 
Also, these more restrictive eng commands need a fine-grained control mechanism so that they can be
safely executed by authorized person having specific role at subsystem level. To achieve this we have the
role hierarchy at subsystem level along with a config table containing the mapping between more restrictive
commands and these roles.

This type of role hierarchy is created in Keycloak as one time setup.
As per this hierarchy there should be three roles present for each subsystem which are composed in specific order.

* E.g. TCS-admin -> TCS-eng -> TCS-user. 
    * When you assign a user TCS-eng role, keycloak will automatically add TCS-user role to that user
    * When you assign a user TCS-admin role, keycloak will automatically add TCS-eng and TCS-user role to that user

Also, there are three special roles. OSW-admin, OSW-eng and OSW-user which are composed of all respective subsystem level roles. 

* E.g. When you assign a user OSW-eng role, keycloak will automatically add roles TCS-eng, APS-eng and so on to that
user and these roles will automatically add their respective lower level roles TCS-user, APS-user and so on.
 
#### Examples:

![User Roles](../images/gateway/user-roles.png)

#### Command Role Mapping
Below shown are example entries in config table with commands and roles who can execute those commands.

```
IRIS.filter.wheel.startExposure: [IRIS-user, APS-eng]
IRIS.filter.wheel.stopExposure: [IRIS-user, APS-eng]
```

We need to create a config containing role mapping entries like shown above and use it when starting esw-gateway server. 

### Protection on Sequencer endpoints on Gateway  

On protected endpoints of sequencer commands in esw-gateway, {subsystem}-user role check is performed. 

* Subsystem is obtained from componentId
* E.g. If current sequence to be executed is for esw.primary then user should have minimum ESW-user role.
