# esw-shell

This project contains an interactive shell and allows its users to gain access to all the major csw services via CLI
which then can be used to communicate with a HCD (Hardware Control Daemon) and an Assembly using
TMT Common Software ([CSW](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw)) APIs and with a Sequencer using
TMT Executive Software ([ESW](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/esw)).

## Build Instructions

The build is based on sbt and depends on libraries generated from the 
[csw](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw) and [esw](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/esw) project.

## Prerequisites for running Components

The CSW services need to be running before starting the components.
This is done by starting the `csw-services.sh` script, which is installed as part of the csw build.
If you are not building csw from the sources, you can get the script as follows:

- Download csw-apps zip from https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw/releases.
- Unzip the downloaded zip.
- Go to the bin directory where you will find `csw-services.sh` script.
- Run `./csw_services.sh --help` to get more information.
- Run `./csw_services.sh start` to start the location service and config server.

## Running the esw-shell using sbt

After making sure that all the pre-requisites are satisfied, we can directly run the esw-shell via sbt from the root directory of the project

- Run `sbt esw-shell/run`

## Running esw-shell using Coursier

- Add TMT apps channel to your local Coursier installation using below command

```bash
cs install --add-channel https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmtsoftware/osw-apps/master/apps.json
```

- After adding TMT apps channel you can simply launch esw-shell by executing

```bash
cs launch esw-shell:<version | SHA>
```

## Usage of Command Service to interact with HCDs, Assemblies and Sequencers

### Finding the required component

Get handle to the command service for a particular HCD/Assembly/Sequencer using following commands within esw-shell repl

- For HCDs
 `val hcdComponent = hcdCommandService("iris.hcd_name")`
- For Assemblies
 `val assemblyComponent = assemblyCommandService("iris.assembly_name")`
- For Sequencers
 `val sequencer = sequencerCommandService(IRIS, "darknight")`

**iris.hcd_name** and **iris.assembly_name** are the prefix by which both HCD and Assembly components were registered with location service respectively.

**IRIS** and **darknight** are the subsystem and the observing mode for the sequencer respectively.

Note - The above calls internally uses location service to resolve the required HCD/Assembly/Sequencer.

### Creating the commands to submit to HCD/Assembly

Create a setup command object using similar command to what is shown below

```scala
import csw.params.commands._
import csw.prefix.models.Prefix
import csw.params.core.models.ObsId
// above imports are available in shell, user does not need to import again

val setup = Setup(Prefix("iris.filter.wheel"),CommandName("move"),Some(ObsId("2020A-P001-O123")))
```

### Creating the sequence to submit to Sequencer

```scala
import csw.params.commands._
import csw.prefix.models.Prefix
import csw.params.core.models.ObsId
// above imports are available in shell, user does not need to import again

val setup = Setup(Prefix("iris.filter.wheel"),CommandName("move"),Some(ObsId("2020A-P001-O123")))
val sequence = Sequence(setup)
```

Other than command service handles, following pre-defined handles or factories are available in shell to interact with different services:

- For Sequence Manager, use pre-imported `sequenceManager` handle
- For Agent, create new handle using `agentClient("iris.machine_1")`
- For AdminApi, use pre-imported `adminApi` handle
- For EventService, use pre-imported `eventService` handle
- For AlarmService, use pre-imported `alarmService` handle

### Creating ComponentId

```scala
import csw.prefix.models.Prefix
import csw.prefix.models.Subsystem.ESW
import csw.location.api.models.ComponentId
import csw.location.api.models.ComponentType.Assembly
// above imports are available in shell, user does not need to import again

val componentId = ComponentId(Prefix(ESW, "test1"), Assembly)
```

### Creating Event

```scala
import csw.params.core.generics.Parameter
import csw.params.core.generics.KeyType.ByteKey
import csw.prefix.models.Prefix
import csw.params.events.{EventName, SystemEvent}

val byteKey = ByteKey.make("byteKey")
val paramSet: Set[Parameter[_]] = Set(byteKey.set(100, 100 ))
val prefix = Prefix("tcs.assembly")
val event = SystemEvent(prefix, EventName("event_1"), paramSet)
```

### Creating AlarmKey

```scala
import csw.alarm.models.Key.AlarmKey
import csw.prefix.models.Prefix
import csw.prefix.models.Subsystem.NFIRAOS

val alarmKey = AlarmKey(Prefix(NFIRAOS, "trombone"), "tromboneAxisHighLimitAlarm")
```

### Submitting the commands to components

Submit the setup command object created in a previous step using command service for the HCD/Assembly

- `val hcdResponse = hcdComponent.submit(setup).get` 
- `val assemblyResponse = assemblyComponent.submit(setup).get`
 
Submit the sequence object created in a previous step using command service for the Sequencer

- `val sequencerResponse = sequencer.submit(sequence).get`

### Submitting the commands to service

To Sequence Manager

- `val configureResponse = sequenceManager.configure(ObsMode("darknight")).get`
- `val shutdownSequencerResponse = sequenceManager.shutdownSequencer(ESW, ObsMode("darknight")).get`

To Agent

- `val agent = agentClient("iris.machine_1")`
- `val spawnResponse = agent.spawnSequenceComponent("ESW_1", Some("1.0.0")).get`

To AdminApi

- `val logMetadata = adminApi.getLogMetadata(componentId).get`

To EventService

- `val publishResponse = eventService.publish(event).get`

To AlarmService

- `val response = alarmService.setSeverity(alarmKey, AlarmSeverity.Major).get`
